\subsection*{Conclusion}


The education levels, field of study, industry of employment and occupation was studied for the Victorian SA4 level populations for the distributions according to gender and sex. The tables and plots were compared to mark the covariations between the population distributions.For example, the population trend between the field of study and industry of employment. Networks were drawn based on the population weights to analyze these trends. Some of the trends like more men were employed as managers when more women had studied management were found to be interesting. Chloropeth maps were made to analyze these trends spatially. Indeed, there exists an association between these topics as the numbers were parallel in related sub-divisions within each topic. In conclusion it was found that highest population for education level is bachelor degree, for field of education is management and commerce, industry of employment is health care and social assistance and occupation is professionals.

The goal of this report was to create a data story from these statistical summaries to enumerate the facts from the data and link them to the real world. The data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is aggregated open data and in no form identifies individuals who participated in the census. The ABS aims to integrate the census data with other datasets to make this census data more interesting. Thus, we analyzed the data from Victorian Public Sector Commission to support some of the insights made from this ABS Census 2016 data.

\section{Introduction}

<!--
# Introduction
-->

The Australian Bureau of Statistics(ABS) conducts the census for Australia every 5 years which includes all people present in Australia on the census night irrespective of their nationality. @CensusDefinition defines census as "systematically calculating, acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. This term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses." A census aims to include the entire population as supposed to sampling and therefore data is recorded for every individual. However, when this data is released in public for interested institutions such as businesses, other government organizations, NGOs and other researchers it is only ethical to de-identify the data. Ethics has always been argued for risk versus benefit. With census data capturing personal details it must be de-identified and therefore ABS makes it available after perturbation as aggregated data @absdataprocess .  

Census being a population data is able to capture insights about small geographic boundaries and demographics precisely. The 2016 Census data was output using the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard @absasgs .The ABS Structures are a hierarchy of areas developed for the release of ABS statistical information. This statistical information represents data for all census geographies from Australia down to Statistical Area Level 1. @CensusDefinition say "Data can be represented visually or analyzed in complex statistical models, to show the difference between certain areas, or to understand the association between different personal characteristics."

Our report is based on 2016 census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics(ABS). In 2016, Census collected data for 10 million dwellings and approximately 24 million people, the largest number counted to date. The report dwells on the SA4 regions of Victoria and the topics for analysis are the Field of Study, Education Qualifications, Industry of Employment and Occupation. We try to determine the association between these topics based on age and gender. To further support these association insights, data from the Victorian Public Sector Commission(VPSC) is included.

\section{Data Preparation}

The census data was not in accordance to the tidy data definition and was spread across multiple files. Datapacks are provided in CSV format. Geopacks include comprehensive data files and associated Geographic Information System (GIS) boundary files in a format suitable for loading into proprietary software and/or client custom-built systems. Hence appropriate cleaning was performed and cell values were renamed in a more human readable context. This cleaning method was well tutored by @datacleaning in the lectures of [ETC5512]("https://wcd.numbat.space/tutorials/tutorial-07.html").
