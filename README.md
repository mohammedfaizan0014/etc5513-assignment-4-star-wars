The Australian Census is conducted every five years and includes all the people present in Australia on the night of Census. The last Australian Census was conducted in August, 2016.
This Census contains aggregated data about various topics, including the education qualification and employment of the people. For this project, we will be analyzing the 2016 Census data on these topics for the SA4 regions of Victoria.
Subsequent information will be added to the README file as the project progresses.
