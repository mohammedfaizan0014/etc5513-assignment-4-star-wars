presentation3.html is our presentation on the analysis of the ABS Census 2016 data.



The Australian Census is conducted every five years and includes all the people present in Australia on the night of Census. The last Australian Census was conducted in August, 2016.
This Census contains aggregated data about various topics, including the education qualification and employment of the people. For this project, we will be analyzing the 2016 Census data on these topics for the SA4 regions of Victoria.

Census being a population data is able to capture insights about small geographic boundaries and demographics precisely. The 2016 Census data was output using the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard.The ABS Structures are a hierarchy of areas developed for the release of ABS statistical information. This statistical information represents data for all census geographies from Australia down to Statistical Area Level 1. Wikipedia contributors say "Data can be represented visually or analyzed in complex statistical models, to show the difference between certain areas, or to understand the association between different personal characteristics."

Our report is based on 2016 census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics(ABS). In 2016, Census collected data for 10 million dwellings and approximately 24 million people, the largest number counted to date. The report dwells on the SA4 regions of Victoria and the topics for analysis are the Field of Study, Education Qualifications, Industry of Employment and Occupation. We try to determine the association between these topics based on age and gender. To further support these association insights, data from the Victorian Public Sector Commission(VPSC) is included.

The Victorian Public Sector Commission (VPSC) was established on 1 April 2014, and it has a range of legislated functions to help strengthen the efficiency, effectiveness and capability of the public sector and maintain its integrity. This report will be analyzed based on the survey data collected and reported by VPSC to support the arguments made from ABS data.

The education levels, field of study, industry of employment and occupation was studied for the Victorian SA4 level populations for the distributions according to gender and sex. The tables and plots were compared to mark the covariations between the population distributions.For example, the population trend between the field of study and industry of employment. Networks were drawn based on the population weights to analyze these trends. Some of the trends like more men were employed as managers when more women had studied management were found to be interesting. Chloropeth maps were made to analyze these trends spatially. Indeed, there exists an association between these topics as the numbers were parallel in related sub-divisions within each topic. In conclusion it was found that highest population for education level is bachelor degree, for field of education is management and commerce, industry of employment is health care and social assistance and occupation is professionals.

The goal of this report was to create a data story from these statistical summaries to enumerate the facts from the data and link them to the real world. The data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is aggregated open data and in no form identifies individuals who participated in the census. The ABS aims to integrate the census data with other datasets to make this census data more interesting. Thus, we analyzed the data from Victorian Public Sector Commission to support some of the insights made from this ABS Census 2016 data.

To support the arguments made by the main report based on the ABS data, this report is created to further understand the employment type, industry, occupation, and their salary in Victoria according to the gender.

Findings that employees in health-related industry and occupation earn the most was further proved the reason why health services have the largest number of employees. However, there is a huge difference in salary between employees of different genders, that male employees are paid more than female, and as found in the main report, more men were employed as managers when more women had studied management. Even though majority of female are with high education level and practical skills for works, they are still facing inequality in the workplace. The discrimination against women at work place is a serious historical issue and measures have to be taken to realize gender equality.
